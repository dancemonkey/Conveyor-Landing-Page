marketing_header: "More Doing, Less Fiddling"
marketing_desc: "Conveyor simplifies the process of creating and managing your to-do lists. Instead of fiddling with due dates, times, tags, and categories you just add a task to one of three lists: Today, Tomorrow, or Later. Every day the tasks moves themselves from list to list (Later -> Tomorrow -> Today, but you can lock items if you need a few extra days before something comes due). Siri integration and a Today widget make adding items and managing your lists easy."
